Jenkins Pipeline as Code

1. Declarative Pipeline
2. Scripted Pipeline

Declarative Pipeline syntax alwasys starts with the keyword "pipeline"
Scripted Pipeline syntax always starts with keyword "node"

We can still use "script block" inside Declarative Pipeline

Simple Hello World pipeline:

pipeline{
    agent any
    stages{
        stage("Hello"){
            steps{
                echo "Hello World"
            }
        }
    }
}

If we specify agent as "none" in the above pipeline example, then it will run on the Jenkins master

If we have a Jenkins slave node named "Slave 1", then we can specify label to run the pipeline on that slave

pipeline{
    agent{
        label "Slave 1"
    }
    stages{
        stage("Hello"){
            steps{
                echo "Hello World"
            }
        }
    }
}

This will run the pipeline on Jenkins slave named "Slave 1"


Custom Workspace:
We can specify a custom workspace for our pipeline by using customworkspace attribute of agent as in the below example...

pipeline{
    agent{
        label "Slave 1"
        customworkspace "/home/ec2-user/customworkspace"
    }
    stages{
        stage("Hello"){
            steps{
                echo "Hello World"
            }
        }
    }
}


Script Block:
We can use script block to run groovy scripts inside out declarative pipeline as below...

pipeline{
    agent any
    stages{
        stage('Build'){
            steps{
                script{
                    def name = "jesse"
                    
                    if(name == "jesse")
                        println("Hi ${name}")
                    else
                        println("Hi human")
                    
                    sleep 2
                    echo "end of script"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Here the "sleep" step in the above pipeline comes from "Workflow Basic Steps" plugin
