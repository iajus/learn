Container Native Load Balancing on GKE:

10th September 2018

Three Items:
1. Containers as first-class load balancer endpoints
2. Kubernetes Engine native support for L7 authorization, security, caching and modern protocols
3. Comming Soon

Kubernetes 1.0 launched in 2015


Exposing Services to the Internet

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
  - port: 80
  type: ClusterIP


NodePort:
Uses Node's IP, exposes a service on the same port on every node.
>Simple to understand
>Portable: No external dependencies
<Limited to ports 30000-32767
<Clients need to adapt to Node IP changes
<Can not use advanced features
<Suboptimal load balancing, just provides basic load balancing algorithm


LoadBalancer:
>Simple to understand model
>Portable across supported platforms
>Service exposed thru external IP address
<Lack of advanced features
<Suboptimal load balancing


Ingress:
>Portable across implementations
>Support common L7 constructs: (e.g. TLS termination, URL path mapping)
<Supports only a single K8s cluster
<Suboptimal load balancing
There are many Ingress impplementations, on GKE Google Cloud Load balancer is used to implement Ingress


Data path in Kubernetes Load Balancing:

In a typical Ingress setup, Load Balancer points to an Instance Group.
The Instance Group contains all cluster Nodes
The kube-proxy running on each of the Nodes is responsible for forwarding the traffic to actual Pods
Kube-proxy programs the iptables on the VMs to forward traffic to the Pods
This setup results in inefficient performance due to multiple network hops

i.e. iptables may select a Pod that is on a different Node, thus adding a extra network hop
the response packet passes through the same VM adding another netwokr hop


Network Endpoint Group: (Currently in alpha)
>Containers are "just another endpoints"
>Accurate cloud-level health checks and load balancing
>No extra network hops; direct connection from load balancer to container
NO iptables magic, NO proxy involved, NO NAT, NO second hop

>Containers first approach
Native support of Google Cloud Load Balancer features.
Traffic shaping
Advanced load balancing algorithms

>Optimal data path
Eliminates extra network hop
Reduces end-to-end request latency
Predictable network performance

>Visibility
Makes it easier to troubleshoot our services at Pod level
Accurate health checks

kind: BackendConfig.cloud.google.com
apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1beta1
metadata:
  ...

>Specify configuration on a per service basis
>Service configuration becomes first class concept
>BackendConfig + Ingress play well together
