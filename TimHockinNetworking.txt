GCP Next 17
***********

API Server:
-----------
Kubernetes is a very API-centric system - everything communicates through API
> No Private APIs
> No "System Only" calls

REST: Defined in terms of "resources" (nouns, aka "objects") and methods (verbs)


PODs:
-----
A small group of tightly coupled containers & volumes, composed together
The atom of Kubernetes
Shared lifecycle and fate
Shared networking - a shared "real" IP, containers see each other as localhost


Controller:
-----------
A piece of code that watches the Kubernetes API and reacts
The defining pattern of Kubernetes, used everywhere
Self-healing, aka rectification
Example: ReplicaSet, Services, DNS, Kubelet


Labels:
-------
Metadata (key-value) which can be attached to any API resource

Labels: identification
> Allow users to define how to group resources
> Examples: app name, tier (frontend/backend), stage (dev/test/prod)

Annotations: data that "rides along" with objects
> Third-party or internal state that isn't part of an object's schema


Selectors:
----------
Expresses which objects to act upon
> Think "select ... where"

Provides very loose coupling
Users can manage groups however they need
Examples: services, deployments


The IP-per-pod model
--------------------
Every pod has a real IP address
This is different from the out-of-the-box model Docker offers
> No machine-private IPs
> No port-mapping

Pod IPs are accessible from other Pods, regardless of which VM they are on
Linux "network namespaces" (aka "netns") and Virtual interfaces


Flat network space:
-------------------
Pods must be reachable accross VMs too

Kubernetes doesn't care HOW, but this is required
> L2, L3, or overlay

Assign a CIDR (IP block) to each VM
GCP: Teach the network how to route packets


Programming GCP's network:
--------------------------
GKE automatically sets up routing for you using every trick it needs

All VMs are created as "routers"
> --can-ip-forward
> Disable anti-spoof protection for this VM

Add one GCP static route for each VM
> gcloud compute routes create vm2 --destination-range=x.y.z.0/24 --next-hop-instance=vm2

The GCP network does the rest

Dealing with change:
--------------------
You need something more durable than a pod IP

A real cluster changes over time:
> Scale-up and scale-down events
> Rolling updates
> Pods crash or hang
> VMs reboot

The Pod addresses you want to talk to can change without warning


The Service abstraction:
------------------------
A service is a group of endpoints (usually pods)
Service provides a stable VIP

VIP automatically routes to backend pods
> Implementations can vary
> We will examin the default implementation

The set of pods "behind" a service can change

Clients only need the VIP, which doesn't change


Service:
--------
What you submit is simple
> other fields will be defaulted or assigned

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: store-be
spec:
  selector:
    app: store
    role: be
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80


Service:
--------
What you get back has more information
Automatically creates a distributed load balancer

The default is to allocate an in-cluster IP for your service "ClusterIP"

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: store-be
  namespace: default
  creationTimestamp: 2018-05-06T19:16:56Z
  resourceVersion: "7"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/services/store-be
  uid: 196d5751-13bf-11e6-9353-42010a800fe3
Spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: store
    role: be
  clusterIP: 10.9.3.76
  ports:
  - name: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  sessionAffinity: None


Endpoints:
----------
When you create a service, a controller wakes up

Holds the IPs of the pod backends

kind: Endpoints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: store-be
  namespace: default
subsets:
- addresses:
  - ip: 10.11.8.67
  - ip: 10.11.5.3
  - ip: 10.11.0.9
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP


Conntrack:
----------
Linux kernel connection-tracking

Remembers address translations
> Based on the 5-tuple IP header 

Does a lot more, but not very relevant here

Reversed on the return path

{
  protocol = TCP
  src_ip = pod1
  src_port = 1234
  dst_ip = svc1
  dst_port = 80
} => {
  protocol = TCP
  src_ip = pod1
  src_port = 1234
  dst_ip = pod99
  dst_port = 80
}


A bit more on iptables:
-----------------------
The iptable rules look scary, but are actually simple:

if dest.ip == svc1.ip && dest.port == svc1.port {
  pick one of the backends at random
  rewrite destination IP
}

Configured by 'kube-proxy' - a pod running on each VM
> Not actually a proxy
> Not in the data path

kube-proxy is a controller - it watches the API for services


DNS:
----
Even easier: services are addes to an in-cluster DNS server

You would never hardcode an IP, but you might hardcode a hostname and port
Serves "A" and "SRV" records
DNS itself runs as pods and a service


DNS Service:
------------
Requests a particular Cluster IP

Pods are auto-scaled with the cluster size

Service VIP is stable

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: kube-dns
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  clusterIP: 10.0.0.10
  selector:
    k8s-app: kube-dns
  ports:
  - name: dns
    port: 53
    protocol: UDP
  - name: dns-tcp
    port: 53
    protocol: TCP


Services: Simple and Powerful:
------------------------------
Can use any port you want, no conflicts
Can request a particular 'clusterIP'
Can remap port

Services are AN ABSTRACTION - the API is a VIP
NO RUNNING PROCESS or intercepting the data-path
All a client needs to do is hit the service IP:port


Sending external traffic:
-------------------------
Services are within a cluster
What happens if you want your pod to reach google.com?


Leaving the GCP project:
------------------------
VMs get private IPs (in 10.0.0.0/8)
VMs can have public IPs too
GCP: Public IPs are provided by 1-to-1 NAT

1-to-1 NAT inside GCP only understands VM IPs
> Anything else gets dropped

Pod IPs != VM IPs

When is doubt, add some more iptables
> MASQUERADE, aka SNAT

Applies to any packet with a destination *outside* of 10.0.0.0/8


Receiving external traffic:
---------------------------
GCP offers multiple products here

Kubernetes builds on two:
> Network Load Balancer (L4)
> HTTP/S Load Balancer (L7)

These map to Kubernetes APIs:
> Service type=LoadBalancer
> Ingress
