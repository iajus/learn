Globally Scalable Microservices with GKE and Cloud Load Balancing:

11th September 2018

Meme Service:

MemeCreator: Stateles Microservice

dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
restartPolicy: Always
securityContext: {}
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30


MongoDB Database: Stateful

MongoDB is NOT "Cloud Native": Unlike few other DBs, MongoDB can't handle node failure
PersistentVolumes: Data volume that persists even if the pod restarts or moves
Sidecar Container: A container that helps the primary container do its job
StatefulSets: Set of Pods that can scale horizontally with each Pod maintaining a consistent network and disk identity
Headless Service: A service that does not do load balancing, but exposes the Pods directly with DNS

kubefed: Command line tool that simplifies federation setup
